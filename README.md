# SMOTE
Data over-sampling with SMOTE 

Proposed in 2002 in the journal of artifical intelligence, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique is an alternative to random over-sampling, said to be source of overfitting. 
Data Science and Machine Learning use cases with unbalanced targets are recurrent (fraud detection, disease detection, predictive maintenance...)

The objective of this tiny use case is to introduce how the algorithm works, and how it could improve metrics for classification models.
